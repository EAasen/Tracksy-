## Overview
This project is an open-source alternative to fitness tracking platforms like Strava, focused on providing users full control over their data. The platform supports data integration from a wide range of sources, including Garmin Connect, Apple Health, Android Health, Huawei Health, Coros, Fitbit, Samsung Health, Wahoo, Suunto, Polar, and more.

The platform offers two deployment models:

### Self-Hosted Solution
Users can self-host their instance to manage their data independently and set up custom integrations.

### Hosted Solution
Subscribe to a managed service with options for integration and a developer marketplace for third-party applications.

Data privacy and user control are at the core of the platform. Users can decide who accesses their data, ensuring complete transparency and security.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Data Integration**: Sync data from various health and fitness ecosystems.
  - *Example*: Connect your Garmin device to sync your running and cycling activities.
- **Activity Tracking**: Log and visualize activities like running, cycling, swimming, and more.
  - *Example*: Track your weekly running mileage and visualize it on a graph.
- **Health Metrics**: Collect and display metrics such as heart rate, sleep, and recovery.
  - *Example*: Monitor your sleep patterns and heart rate variability over time.
- **Custom Analytics**: Generate detailed reports and insights based on your activities.
  - *Example*: Create a custom report to analyze your performance trends over the past year.

### Unique Features
- **Multi-Source Data Integration**: Unlike many competitors, Tracksy supports a wide range of data sources, giving users more flexibility.
